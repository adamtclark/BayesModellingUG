## Your turn: Homework 2:

Try fitting different structures of models (combinations of fixed effect slopes and intercepts, and random effects vs. nested random effects).

```{r echo=TRUE}
bdat = read.csv("dataset_2.csv")
n_plots = length(unique(bdat$plot))

# plot
par(mar=c(4,4,2,2))
plot(biomass~diversity, col = rainbow(n_plots)[plot], pch = subplot, data = bdat)
```

Note - different point types show different subplots, and different colors show different plots. We can plot these trends a bit more informatively using the `coplot` command. It is set up similarly to the `lme` function (with some extra bits that we'll discuss later).

```{r echo=TRUE}
par(mar=c(4,4,2,2))
coplot(biomass~diversity|as.factor(plot), data = bdat,
       panel = function(x, y, ...) {points(x,y, pch = bdat$subplot[bdat$plot==1])})
```

What form of regression should you use? Random slopes? Random intercepts? Nested? Something else?

What do the results of the regression show us? What are the fixed and random effects estimates? What is the variability across parameters?

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
